                        <li>Pick a line (vertical or horizontal), and do all the tasks in it. Click/tap on a box to mark it as complete. If a goal has several stages, each click/tap will advance by 1; the box will be marked as complete once the final stage is complete.</li>
                        <li>To unmark a goal/undo progress, right click or long-press</li>
                        <li>Click/tap on a goal box to highlight the whole line, to help you keep track</li>
                        <li>Some goals have clarification. These are marked with a golden highlight. Hover the mouse over the box to read them.</li>

                    <h2>Rules</h2>
                    <p>Note: these rules are only suggestions. Feel free to do whatever you want, as long as all participants agree.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skyrim should be close to vanilla, but can include all official DLC and addons. Certain QOL mods are allows (eg, SkyUI), etc as long as they don't modify the content of the game too much. Things like Unoffical Patches are fine, and encouraged.</li>
                        <li>One major exception to this is a mod like Live Another Life, which allows you to skip the first part of the game. However, you should not count a bonus given by such a mod for a goal. Eg, if LAL lets you start as a home owner, that does not count for "Own property" goals</li>
                        <li>All participants should use the same or similar mods.</li>
                        <li>Save scumming is allowed and encouraged (otherwise, "Be killed" goals would be impossible). However, goals like "Collect items" refer to unique instances, so you can't just reload your save and pick up the same item multiple times.</li>
                        <li>The console MAY NOT be used to accomplish any goals. Using it to eg, save is fine. Spawning items/advancing quests, not so much</li>
                        <li>The use of bugs and exploits in game is discouraged, especially if not agreed to by all participants</li>
